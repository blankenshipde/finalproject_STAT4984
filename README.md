The following code was used to perform sentiment analysis for my final project in Deep Learning (STAT4984) at Virginia Tech.  
The code is mostly self contained and only requires a single line to be changed to function properly.  Which is the path variable in the library import code cell.  This allows the code to find the IMDB dataset and
save the machine leanring models in the same file path.  

The LSTM classifier model was uploaded, however, the DistilBERT model was not able to be uploaded due to its large file size.
